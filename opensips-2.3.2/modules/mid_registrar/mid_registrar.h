/*
 * Support for:
 *  - REGISTER traffic throttling, optionally with contact aggregation
 *  - processing registrations upon receiving 200 OK replies
 *
 * This module is intended to be used as a middle layer SIP component in
 * environments where a large proportion of SIP UAs (e.g. mobile devices)
 * register at high enough frequencies that they actually degrade the
 * performance of their registrars.
