1.1. Overview

   The "freeswitch" module is a C driver for the FreeSWITCH Event
   Socket Layer interface. It can interact with one or more
   FreeSWITCH servers either by issuing commands to them, or by
   receiving events from them.

   This driver can be seen as a centralized FreeSWITCH ESL
   connection manager. OpenSIPS modules may use its API in order
   to easily establish, reference and reuse ESL connections.

   A FreeSWITCH ESL URL is of the form:
   fs://[username]:password@host[:port]. The default ESL port is
   8021.
