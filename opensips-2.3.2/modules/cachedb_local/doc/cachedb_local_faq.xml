		<question>
		<para> What happened with old cache_table_size parameter? </para>
		</question>
		<answer>
		<para>
			The parameter was removed because it was redundant. Since the
			addition of collections, the old hash now belongs to the
			default collection. This collection is created every time and
			it has a default size of 512. The size can be changed by
			setting the default collection size using cache_collections paramter.
